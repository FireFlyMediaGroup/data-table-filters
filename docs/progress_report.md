# Project Progress Report

## Overview

This document serves as a master reference for the current state of the project, detailing what has been developed, what needs to be reviewed, and the next steps in the development process. It is intended to provide a clear understanding of the project's status for both AI assistants and human developers.

## Current State

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- Supabase Auth has been implemented with enhanced security measures:
  - Email/Password login with magic link as a second factor.
  - Google Workspace SSO restricted to company email addresses.
  - No public sign-ups to prevent unauthorized access.
- The login page (src/app/login/page.tsx) has been updated to support the new authentication flow.
- Authentication middleware (src/middleware/auth.ts) has been implemented to protect dashboard routes.
- Role-based access control middleware (src/middleware/rbac.ts) has been implemented to restrict access based on user roles.
- A combined middleware (src/middleware/index.ts) has been created to apply both authentication and RBAC checks.
- A callback handler (src/app/auth/callback/route.ts) has been created to handle the OAuth callback.
- A script to seed the initial admin user (scripts/seed-users.ts) has been created.
- Comprehensive documentation on the authentication workflow and admin user management has been added (docs/authentication-workflow.md).

**To be reviewed:**
- Testing of the new authentication flow and RBAC middlewares to ensure they're working as expected.
- Integration of the authentication state with the frontend components.
- Setup of Google Workspace SSO and Supabase configuration (instructions in docs/authentication-workflow.md).
- Implementation of the admin user interface for user management.

**Google OAuth and Supabase Configuration Instructions:**

1. Set up Google OAuth credentials:
   a. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   b. Create a new project or select an existing one.
   c. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
   d. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
   e. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
   f. Add authorized JavaScript origins (your app's URL) and authorized redirect URIs (your Supabase project's URL + /auth/v1/callback).
   g. Note down the Client ID and Client Secret.

2. Configure Supabase:
   a. Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
   b. Navigate to "Authentication" > "Providers".
   c. Find "Google" in the list and click "Edit".
   d. Enable the Google provider.
   e. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret obtained from the Google Cloud Console.
   f. Save the changes.

3. Update environment variables:
   a. Add the following variables to your .env.local file:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
      NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

4. Test the authentication:
   a. Run your application and try logging in with both magic link and Google SSO options.
   b. Verify that users are redirected correctly after authentication.
   c. Check that the RBAC is working as expected for different user roles.

### 2. Database and ORM

- Prisma has been set up and integrated with the project.
- The Prisma schema (prisma/schema.prisma) has been created with models for User, Document, POWRA, Tailboard, and FPLMission.

**To be reviewed:**
- Verify that the Prisma schema accurately reflects all required data models.
- Ensure that the Prisma client is correctly set up and used throughout the application.

### 3. Document Management

- The document management API (src/app/api/documents/route.ts) has been implemented with CRUD operations and bulk status updates.
- The API supports fetching, creating, updating, deleting, and bulk updating of documents.

**To be reviewed:**
- Verify that the existing document forms (POWRA, Tailboard, FPL Mission) implement progressive completion and validation as specified in the masterplan.
- Ensure that the document management API supports all required operations, including bulk approvals.

### 4. User Management

- Implemented an admin user management interface (src/app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx) with the following features:
  - Create new users with email, password, and role
  - View existing users with pagination
  - Update user roles
  - Delete users (with confirmation dialog)
  - Reset user passwords
  - Search users by email
  - Filter users by role
- Added error handling and user feedback using react-toastify
- Created an API route for password reset (src/app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts)
- Implemented pagination for the user list to handle large numbers of users
- Enhanced error handling and success messages for user management operations
- Added detailed validation for user input:
  - Email format validation (server-side and client-side)
  - Password strength validation (server-side and client-side, at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character)
- Implemented client-side validation for email and password fields, providing immediate feedback to users
- Implemented rate limiting for the following operations to prevent abuse:
  - Password reset functionality
  - User creation
  - User role updates
  - User deletion

**To be reviewed:**
- Consider adding more advanced search options (e.g., search by name, date range for user creation).
- Implement audit logging for sensitive user management operations.

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness

**To be reviewed:**
- Review and optimize all components for mobile devices, ensuring they adhere to the responsive design principles outlined in the masterplan.
- Implement mobile-first features such as touch-friendly controls and swipe gestures.

### 6. Security Enhancements

**To be reviewed:**
- Implement row-level security in the database.
- Set up data encryption for sensitive information.
- Implement an audit trail system for logging user actions, document history, and access logs.

### 7. Testing

**To be reviewed:**
- Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) and create a dedicated test directory.
- Implement unit tests for individual components and functions.
